## What the hell is harmonic syllables?
in general, it doesnt exists, I've invented this term, but the meaning is: <br>
When a word is harmonic, it's easily pronunciable, the main thing of this is vowels and consonants, which makes the word have a pseudo-meaning. The words may not really combine, but it's "readable".

Examples: <br>
`Coir`, `Kyle`, `Sine`, `Keep` are harmonic, they use `Cvcv` and `Cvvc` (also `Cccv` but it's too specific)

`Qhil`, `Wzec`, `Czkg`, `Ylxq` are NOT harmonic, some syllabes doesn't combines at all

One of the rules of harmonic syllabes is "continuable letters", e.g: `H`, h is a letter that if not on the start/end of the word can be extended, like:
`Shop`: SHO -> ccv | h can be extended with any vowel
`Lying`: LY -> cc | l can be extended with some consonants and with any vowel, the reason of this is our tongue, our tongue accepts soft word combinations, which makes our brain think that the word is "common"

and many more combinations, its too complex to explain the lore for it but I think you got it!
